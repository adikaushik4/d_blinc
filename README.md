This repo conatins the projects that were made during Digital Blinc's Internship

Project1: About Score Prediction, this project contains predicting the score of a match before or during the inning.
I used ipywidgets to get the score widgets.

Project2: Second project takes a look at the historical data and tries to predict the best XI before the match.
