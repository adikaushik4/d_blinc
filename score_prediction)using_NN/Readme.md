🧠 Emotion Detector with Emoji 😃😢😡😱
This project is a simple Emotion Detection system that takes a sentence or word as input and returns the most relevant emoji representing the detected emotion.

🔍 Project Objective
To build a lightweight NLP-based system that detects the emotion in a given text input and assigns an appropriate emoji. This can be integrated into chat apps, social media filters, or content moderation tools.

⚙️ How It Works
🧠 Model Strategy
Text Preprocessing:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Tokenization and stopword removal (optional)

Feature Extraction:

Used TF-IDF vectorization for converting text into numeric form.

Model Training:

A simple classifier was used (like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) trained on labeled emotion data.

Classes included: happy, sad, angry, fear, love, surprise, etc.

Emoji Mapping:

Each predicted emotion is mapped to an appropriate emoji:

Joy → 😃

Sad → 😢

Angry → 😡

Fear → 😱



🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

NLTK or SpaCy (for preprocessing)

Streamlit (for UI, if applicable)

🧠 Future Enhancements
Use transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for higher accuracy

Handle multi-label emotion detection

Add multilingual support

Improve UI with audio/voice input
